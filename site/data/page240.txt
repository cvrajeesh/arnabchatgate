Jose Manuel is traveling and he asked me to contact you due an urgent issue:
today we received a letter from WPP Portucal referring that they are selling the
40% of Marktest Group to Kantar Netherlands. We have the right of first refusal
and we think that if BARC could has interest on Marktest to do more synergies
with us, since it could be focused in the spirit of Joint Venture that we were
being speaking, we could buy the stake and sell to BARC. Please let me your
thoughts Best Regardsp (pace
