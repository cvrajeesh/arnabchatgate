of
the news channels both national and regional news channels however the
final
availability at the subscriber household depends on the channel selection done
by the subscriber. also many regional news channels are FTA also NTO
transition is around 60%. therefore pay regional news channels might suffer if
subscribers hv not migrated to NTO but the FTA regional channels will not have
any issue
