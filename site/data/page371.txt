Chat With Romil Ramgaria
(2) BARC meters do not single-out the news genre in its audience measurement
system. If BARC sincerely wants to review and augment its system, it should
pause ratinge for all genres includirg General Entertainment Channels (GEC),
Sports, Inforainment, Movies, Music, Kids, Youth and tifestyle.
(3) Information hao como out recently abcut a channel which has heen found
guilty of TRP manipulation and has been fined by BARC Disciplinary Committee.
NBF is shocked that a member of the same channel has been included on the board
of BARC. taems not just conflicL of interest and no reasonable decicion making
process can happen with a person named in ratings manipulations. What has
happened :tself is shocking. Now the matter is in public domain, this individual
on the Board of BARC should voluntarily renove the said executive from the Board
of Directors for a period of at least one year.
decision is unilateral, one-sided and undemocratic, impacting and
targeting one single genre within the broadcasting ecosystem, ae' said R. Jai
Krishna, General-secretary, and News Broadcasters Federation decision
will severely impact news broadcasters, who have seen a surge in ratings despite
the challenges of a lower-than-expected economic growth that has impacted their
revenues alreacy, in addition to the financial impact created by the lockdown to
prevent spread of Cozid-15.à€
