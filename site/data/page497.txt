Chat With RRP Group
We had requested Derrick to attend todayã€"s meeting, in order to address their
Universe size concern.
Anuradha is not convinced with the Universe size. She feels the size is toc
small to benefit any stakeholder. She said she will also spk to Advertiser
fraternity about their interest in PximaVU. She remarked that the universe BARC
is guoting is similar to Netflix user base right now and said why will
advertisers be interested in targeting such a small universe and that too at
Household level.
She said that instead of subscribing Primavu TV as they will
prefer to use it for qualitative research, to conduct questionnaires and know
their choices, More than TV behaviour she is interested in knowing Digital
behaviour (which we could pitch with our TV+Digital product}
