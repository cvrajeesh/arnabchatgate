2) Second input, that GTPL has made Zee & Sony bouquets freely available to LCOs
but no change in their packages officially
Both options are in contrast of each other. Only ore of the two option is
possible realistically. From data it appears that Zee & Sony channels are being
made available this week which was not the case laot wock trying to find more
details
