-- Parho Dasgupta, management consultant and fermer CEO of BARC India said that
be finds some suggestions ã€very impracticalãe*
per the current quidelines companies can establish a rating agency
provided they are in compliance with some norms. Problem is the business
economics do not support multiple agencies. So, if for so many years nultiple
agencies didn't happen then why will it happen now, ae Dasgupta said. &€cAlso,
if policies have to change so drastically every 4-5 years, who will invest in
such a capex heavy business.ãe
