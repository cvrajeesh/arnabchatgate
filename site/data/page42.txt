organized by the Top Corrupted Advertising Media Officials of Bangladesh! They
work with kantar MRR Bangladesh, which has been selling Audience Datas to
Bangladesh Media Companies, TV Channels, Advertisers etc, but their service has
always been questionable by their clients, which has become a big concern now!
So, Media Forum is trying to bring another agency in Bangladesh to make a fake
challenge against MBB Bangladesh!
