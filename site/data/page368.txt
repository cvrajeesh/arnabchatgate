Big gap in the sample frame as approved by the tech comm Vs what is
executed on ground a€" this leads to inaccuracy in ratings
9)
Multiple communications to subscrobers on Prima Vu Panel ã€" loss product
of BARC which was to be shut but continues to exist under pressure from one news
channels. This cost in indirectly funded by small broadcasters
10) oon neasurement donc only Eor one broadcaster ae" margins ef 2008 - hence
natural inclination there. They also contribute almost 1/3xd of total BARC
revenues across multiple revenue streams (directly and indirectly)
11) Daily data released fur only hindi GEC and hindi movico - partiality again
- why not for other cenres if the processes are automated? Why only available to
broadcasters and why not to agencies/advertisers?
12) Free data given to one broadcaster for 3M ae" another broadcaster charged
from day 1 - inzlination towards one large broadcaster visible ãE" No
standardisation of pricing also
Independence Issues
1) All committees exist merely for paper process ae" the decision making is
fully controlled by BARC executives and is not independent
21 Praveen Tripathi who has been associated with BARC since 2015 as a vendor
and continues to be associated is one member of the 2 member committee a€" big
independence issue
3)
Heavy paynent done to the oversight committee members who follow the
discretion as required ã€" Landing page being case in point when the
recommendation was to remove the full impact however algor:thim was tweaked to
favour the big broadcasters (nevs and non news)
