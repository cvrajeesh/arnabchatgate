7/22/19, 9:22 PM4 - Rushabh Rajesh Mehta: Hello Sir, Sony had confirmed on email
last week that they vud subscribe to PrimaVU. Today I met Commercial Head Mr.
Raaj Gupta, so that ve can expedite the paperwork process.
Even after 1.5 hours of detailed conversation, he remained adamant asking for
some form of bargain either as discount on PrimaVu or some freebies with respect
to any other product, for him to sign on the dotted line.
As he is the Commercial Head, he might delay the process, which is already a
closed deal in a way.
So was thinking if I can cffer him a combo deal of PrimaVU + Bio Music at price
point of 60 of BMW subscription for PrimaVU (abt Rs 1.65 crores) and additional
Rs.10 lacs for 6 music channels for Bio Music. Earlier for Bio Music we had
quoted Rs.2 lacs for 6 channels (but finally they go forward)
This combo doal might help 11.5 gat a sale for both the products Recuesting for
your opinion or this.
