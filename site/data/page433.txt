12/29/18, 5:07 PM - Rushabh Rajesh Mehta: Sir... am nearing one more rumour
donãE™t know how true it is but there might b some trath as well
The protest in Star office was orchestrated there is a hint where Star after
loosing case against TRAI in Supreme Court. somehow wanted to derail the
Tariff order LCOs were galvanised to protest by Star only in mumbai
protest of LCOs in Star office was en eye wash so that no one can blame Star
why did LCOs only protest against Star and no other broadcaster also LCOs knew
abt the Tariff order but remained quite for all this while most MSOS are in
favour of NTO, so LCOs going against MSO is also surprising shall try to dig
out more info on this
12/29/18, 5:14 PM - Rushabh Rajesh Mehta: Star LS telling LCÓs that we fought
NTO only for the benefit cf smaller LCOS.. Star was always against it
