As per new rules, out of amount paid by subscribers, 80% will go to pay channel
broadcasters and we (LCO) wil get only 10%. This will only help broadcasters and
we both i.c., LCO and subacribers will loose As a result, if the price
increases of your television subscription, LCO will not be responsible. We are
fighting against the new rales, for this we wud like to seek your
cooperation...Thank you
