3.21 BARC should review/frame its outlier policy based on scientific study and
market survey conducted from tine to time. BARC should automate data processing
in such a manner that no manual intervention is required before the final TRP
rating is released. Any type of manual intervention in the meter~level /rav data
arising out of household panel must be avoided. Manual intervention, if any, in
abnormal circumstances should be reported and informed to the auditors also.
3.22 Adequate framework for grievance redressal may be made having nodal
officers and Appellate body so that the grievance( (s) of stakeholders can be
effectively addressed in à time-bound manner. BARC should also develoo a portal
wherein any

agency.

conformance with TRP rating methodology, sample size, and grievance redressal

manual should be made to ensure accuracy of the process adopted for ratings,
household-panel selection, functioning, and data collection for overall rating
systems.
