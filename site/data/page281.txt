1/13/20, 12:23 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: *Broadcastersãe™s case against TRAI
taritt order listed for tomorrow*
With just two days remaining for a deadline to file amended TV channel tariffs,
a case filed by Indiaã€ big broadcasters in the Bompay High Court has been
listed for hearing tomorrow in front of Justice SC Dharmadhikari.
Broadcasters, including Star India, 2ee Entertainment, Sony Networks and others,
have come together under the banner cf Indian Broadcasting Foundation to oppose
TRAI&€™s decision to bring down TV channel prices.
In order to prevent a repeat of 2017 situation, in which cases were filed in
several courts across India, TRAI has filed caveats in all the major high courts
against issuing a stay without hearing what it has to say in the matter.
