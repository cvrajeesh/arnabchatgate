2/5/19, 3:04 AM - Vikas Aidem: The weekend of 26 January saw Harvest TVã€"s new
English news channel&€"go live on air in India. Ito boncymoon period was short-
lived. Just two days later, a few hours into the first business day after the
channel&e"s launch, Harvest TV briefly disappeared from airwaves. It was blacked
out on both the platcorms it was available ona6"Airtelae™s (DTH)
service and cable platform Den Networks.
The channel reappeared a few minutes later, but on a different, downgraded
frequency, said Deepak Chcudhry, president of Veecon Media and Broadcasting,
Harvest&e™s promoters. And ever since, things have been on a downward spiral.
Harvest TVã€™s launch was pegged as an important one in the world of television
news media. A political news channel rumoured to be backed by seme politicians
from the Indian National Congress (INC), it launched just ahead of the upcoming
general elections. I: also marks the television comebacks of veteran journalists
like Barkha Dutt and Karan Thapar. But after only a week of its existence,
Harvest TV finds itself knee-deep in controversy. It has already received
multiple legal notices and government complaints. There is a name issue, a logo
problem, an unclear sharefolding pattern, and an association with
Indian National Congress IINC) leader Kapil Sibal.
Ae cf 30 January, the company had been served with three notices from the
information and broadcasting (I&B) ministry asking it to explain these issues,
as well as another legal notice for unauthorised use of a trademark. A According
LO choudhry, the blackout was the result of the IGB sinictry impressing on the
channelã€"s teleport operator Planetcast Media to revert to Harvest TVã€™s
original lower frequancy since the channel did not have permission for the
upgraded one, did 110L respond to The Ken&€"s emailed query.
Harvest TV, or HTN News as it is called or digital media, comes from Delhi-based
Veecon Media and broadcasting Private Limited. Incorporated in 2009, Veecon had
total revenue of Rs 3.8 crore (~$533,000) in FY18 anc runs just one other
television channelã€"a Hindu devotional channel called Kaatyayani TV. Odds are
you heard of Veecon Media. barely been a blip on the Indian
media radar. Harvest TV was meant to be their moment in the sun. But things
havenã€Tt panned out as planned. A A
Rs 660 billion
The size of the Indian teLevision industry as of 2017, according to a Ficci-EY
report.
Everything that Veecon Media has done so far seams rushed. The timing of its
launch is hardly a surprise. Launching ahead of the 2019 general elections will
give it traction and could serve to bolster the general election campaign of the
political party it is rumoured to have ties to. There couldnâ€™t be a better
time to hit the ground running. But in their eagerness to launch, the channel
and its promoters seem to have circunvented various regulatory norms. Shortcuts
that could prove to be Harvestãe™s undoing.
