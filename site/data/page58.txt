12/14/18, 2:30 PM - Romil Ramgaria Bare: Volatility
Since the NCCS could chance with the change of just cne durable, it was highly
volatile
NCCS of HMs chenged between the time the UE study / Lioting exercise was
concucted and approaching them for empanelment
More critically, empanelled HHs changed NCCS ã€" which has potential to create
issues with the panel
This volatility was most apparent in the lower NCCS which were upgrading as
durable ownership bezame more accessible to people across the spectrum
Social Classification:
Over time, NCCS was becoming increasingly less discriminatory in terms of
vievership. Certain groups of genres or channel types (e.g. English,
HD, Business etc.) were &€" "democraticãe™ in terms of viewing patterns across
NCCS. This demonstrated that discrimination on social parameters was weakening
As a result, the system was less efficient for use by stakeholders to make
adequate programming or advertising decisions
