8/15/19, 10:12 AM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: I think holds true if it is q1 20.
1. For Zee Domestic
advertising revenue grew by 4.2% YoY to Rs. 11,322 million. Domestic
subscription revenue grew by 46.7% YoY to Rs. 6,240 million.
2. As per Network 18 q1 investor report - New Tariff Order (NTO) implementation
pains have smoothened as the value-chain adjusts
to the new regime, and OUL subscription income has received a bcost.
3. For network 18, subscription revenue growth in Q1 is 48% yoy whereas Ad
revenues have dropped 48. At an overall level (ad + sube) growth is 108.
Hence, we car. say growth in subscription revenue has compensated drop in ad
revenue
