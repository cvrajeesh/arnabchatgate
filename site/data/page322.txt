5/10/20, 12:22 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: ] request tvo clarifications from those
who have or are considering investing overseas
1. What is better - investing in overseas funds / FOF: or yet held of e
portfolio manager with global reach ( like Citi ) who will construct a
portfolic of 5 -10 scrips. Every Indian citizen can invest overseas USD 250000
per year / so a family of 4 can invest upto USD 1 million ( approx Re 7.5 1.
What kind of return in rupee terms can be expected
2. At this point of time, when the broader market in India, (mid caps & small
caps) is hammered, should one put money in Indian equities or overseas
stocks.
5/10/20, 12:22 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: The answer to this is one word - timing
- 1. Two months ago or closer to end March, I would invest in Nasdag/100 when it
plunged to an all time low of 7000. Now it has crossed 2020 highs and sitting at
9000, about 30% higher than all time lows for 2020
