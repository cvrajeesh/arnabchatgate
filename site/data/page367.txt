10/8/20, 1:33 PM - Romil Rangaria Barc: Governance
1)
No rotation among board members. The entity is controlled by top
broadcasters with no say from snall broadcasters, advertisers and agencies
2)
Tech comm chairman continues to be the same from Day 1
3)
TRAI had mandated not to give raw level data to any broadcaster, despite
that raw level data has been given to a large broadcaster indirectly a€" clear
violation
4)
For large broadcasters the fees have come down from 1% to 0.8% over the
period, however small broadcasters fees have increased from 6L to 18L now ã€"
clear motive to financially burden snall broadcasters more. The fees for small
broadcasters almost comes to 3% to 10% of their annual revenues and is
completely unaffordable. It should be name 8 for all broadcasters
5) There is a rule that tech comm decision can only be over turned by board
with 75% zoting ã€" This is farce €" only on paper and not being followed ã€"
bigital measurement greet ignal, landing page decision etc were completely
driven by large broadcasters only
Process Issues
1)
Arbitrary data cuts happening in channels ã€" there is a discom which was
formed for this purpase. However data cuts happen irrespective of discom
process. This is completely illogical, arbitray and lacks process
2) TV9 was found tampering in one state a€" logically control should be put on
the channel after discom adjudication. However case itselt was not presented to
discom ã€" there is a clear bias in process
3) There are channels which are centrolled but not presented to the discom a€"
no process and bias in presenting the cases
4)
TV viewing is arbitrarily inflated ae" meters that are ok but have not
watched TV are not considered for reporting and hence inflating the TV viewing
artificially
5)
No Universe estimation has happened since 2.5 years ã€" this has been due
to push by layge broadcasters to continue to over-report TV homes
6) Meters should not be in the system which are older than 4 years as per MIB
guidelines however many homes continue to exist
7)
Churn policy was arbitrarily changed and put on the website and no approval
fron tech comm was taken
