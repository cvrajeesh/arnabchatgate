Chat With Romil Ramgaria
5/17/20, 3:03 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: But if foreclosure happens now, means
there will be recovery of 20L from you now and balance payment will happen in
nov
5/17/20, 3:03 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Since the difference between foreclosing
now and nov is 1-2L you are better off making meney in hanc
5/17/20, 3:04 PM - PDGÃO: That's why I may agree to the 20lac being deducted
5/17/20, 3:04 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: As interest income on that will be same
5/17/20, 3:04 PM - PDGÃO: But I start not trusting numbers when it changes
everytime
5/17/20, 3:04 PM - PDGÃO: I remember November calculations had a figure of about
761 in May
5/17/20, J:05 PM - PUGÃO: Then April calculations came as 011 odd
5/17/20, 3:05 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Let me double check this from the old
file he had shared -
5/17/20, 3:05 PM - PDGAO: Now it's 61 lacs
5/17/20, 3:05 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: This is what I had seen - and hence 201
deduction and 61L payment was making sense
5/17/20, 3:05 PM - PDGA©: You see the flipflop?
5/17/20, 3:06 EM - PDGÃO: Yes once you said so I got comfort but not comfortable
with Siva thing
5/17/20, 3:06 EM - PDGÃO: Hope he is not making any other mistakes
5/17/20, 3:06 FM - Romil Famgaria Barc: Let me double check once more
5/17/20, 3:07 PM - PDGÃO: Once in February he said company owes me more then
after 15 days told it's a mistake
5/17/20, 3:07 PM - PDGÃO: This was something on relieving date in system
5/17/20, 3:07 FM - POGÃO: All these do not give you comfort
5/17/20, 3:15 EM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Yes - siva has been in a big mess. Also
on a very sticky wicket - hence is nervous also
5/17/20, 3:15 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Prashang and Rahul both checked these
calculations - i also just reconfirmed
5/17/20, 3:16 PM - PDGÃO: Ok will go with you
5/17/20, 3:16 TM Romil Ramgaria Barc: There is a TCS amount of some 11. which
is part of 15L deduction - and 51 is on account of foreclosure and other
transfer sharges -
5/17/20, 3:16 PM - PDGÃO: Which will be finally donc on actuals I hope
5/17/20, 3:16 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: My sense is, if there is no sales tax
implication :which currently looks the case) - you should get around 2-3L plus
the car in nov - most likely
5/17/20, 3:17 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Yes absolutely
5/17/20, 3:17 PM - PDGÃO Hmmm

trade
5/17/20, 3:18 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Yes ok - must be because of TV9 growth -
