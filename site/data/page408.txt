6/7/19, 12:12 PM - Vikas Aidem: 1. I have perused the Judgment or the TDSAT
dated 29.05.2019 in Broadcasting Appeal No 2 of 2018 in Bennett Coleman & Co.
Ltd & Anr. Vs TRAI and connected matters.
2. The TDSAT has vide its Judgment only discussed the power and auchority of
TRA: to issue directions dated 03.12.2018 to restrain the broadcasters and
distributors of television channels from placing any registered satellite
television channel whose TV rating is released by TV rating agency, on the
landing Logical Channel Number (LCN) or Landing Channel or Boot-up screen. The
TDSAT rendered a considered Judgment that impugned directions are beyond the
provisions of the TRAI Act to issue directions and accordingly quashed the
Direction/order dated 03.12.2018 passed hy TRAT.
3.
The TDSAT, during the course of hearing, had issued Notice to BARC despite
which it has not appeared before the TDSA?. However, based on the materials on
record, following are the relevant paras vhich pertains to existing methodology
adopted by BARC. A perusal of the same goes to show that there vas no reason as
per BARC LO change its methogology of galculating TR?
