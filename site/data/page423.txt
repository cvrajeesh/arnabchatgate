12/6/18, 10:12 AM - Rushach Rajesh Mehta: Sir. Tata Sky had kept abt 12
channels of Sony networks available only on call when the issue happened in
Sep-Oct period the channels did see a decline over weeks the subscribers
wud
hv called on the number provided by Tata sky for reactivating the channel and we
saw viewership increasing over time but not to its original operating
level last week again Tata Sky had deactivated the sony channels and
subscribers had to call up and get the channels activated TataSky had done
this on 29 Nov evening so that their subscribers report as on 30 November shows
lesser active subs of Sony channels that benefited Tata Sky booz they
were
paying Sony channels on per subscriber basis after the negotiations
failed. from lst December most of Sony channels were back from yesterday now
the channels are fully available it means subscribers donãe™t need to call for
activating Sony channels
