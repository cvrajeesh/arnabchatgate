technical requirements @ DPO level.

the paid channels to convert left over viewers.
3) ^Paid Channels:* Post Gist Jan 2019 Trai would aok all paid channels to go
off air for next 15days, Final call would be taken post tomprrow DPO&€™s &
Broadcasters meeting.

28th Feb 2019. (No further discussion is allowed to turn off FTA channels on
Olst Feb 2019 along with paid channels, as been already discussed
&
decided at higher level) In case the conversion was not at par till next
meeting (Mid Feb) there could be a possibility of turning off the FTA channels
as well for non Converted Viewers.
5) 'BARC:* BARC will keep monitoring, measuring & releasing the data the way it
does on weekly basis, no matter Paid channels are available or not.
61 *LCN No.:* LCN No.may change post implementation of new regime.
7) *Genre:* Broadcasters need to define their channe: genre to all the DPOã€Ts
in order to be a part of Suggestive 100 & this could be the reason why a
regional FTA channel in not in that base plan while other regional channels are.
8) *Consumer Choice:* There is no fixed base pack of 1OOFTA channels,itãe™s just
that every DPO & Trai has suggested a list of 100FTA channels (24DD Fixed & 76
other FTA&€"s -Not Fixed) and viewer can make a choice with LCO for his
preferred 76FTA charnel unless he/she want to prefer your channal over other
regional FTA channel.
