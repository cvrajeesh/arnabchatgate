Chat With Romil Ramgaria
2. However in contrast the BSE index holds greater promise going forward. So I
would opt for option 2 above, given that there is no broad based rally that has
occurred yet.
3. To compare the 2 options above we will need to look at a sector specific
index like IT and even with that we will need to be stock specific to look at
cloud based ooftware stocke on either country to establish a like to ike
comparison. In short, be an active investor and if possible engage in stock
selection yourself rather than relying on fund nanagers, whether it be NASDAQ or
BSE.
4. Costs of investing overseas are unknown to the Indian investor like forex
conversion costs, currency appreciation ( Inr vs USD, due for correction), fund
mgmt tees, etc.which will leat into potential returns.
5. In sumnary invest directly in individual stocks which are sector and theme
based and avoid indices which are passive investments, for better returns.. my 2
cents worth!
