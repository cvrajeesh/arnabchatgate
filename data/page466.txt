Arasu has abt 2.8 mn Digital subscribers out of which when they were trying to
convert them to NTO packaging, Arasu was unable to locate abt 0.6 mn
subscribers therefore in the remaining subscribers that they hv is abt 2.2
mn... also Zee Tamilãe™s penetration amongst Arasu digital subscribers stands at
abt 75-80% as of now. while that of Sun TV and Star Vijay is less than
708 the reason given for this is Zee Tamil package is available for Rs.10
while Star Tamil package is available for Rs.25 and Sun Tamil package at
Rs.40

purely based on price offering
