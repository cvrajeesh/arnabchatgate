4/2/20, 4.00 FM - PDGÃO: For those of you using Zoom or for those of you who
that have kids that are using Zoom to communicate with their schools, this is a
serious issue. (Anonymous users 'bombing Zoom neetings with pornographic or
other offensive content.)
As the article states:
"On Zoom, there is a default setting that allows any mecting participant to
share their screen without permission from an eventãe(s host. Anyone who has a
link to a public meeting can join. Links to public Zcoms are traded in Facebook
Groups and Discord chats, and are easily discoverable ou Twitter and public
evert pages.
have been deeply upset to hear about the incidents involving this type of
attack. For those hosting large, public group meetings, we strongly encourage
hosts to change their settings so that only they can share their screen. For
those hosting private meetings, password protections are on by detault and we
recommend that users keep those protections on to prevent uninvited users from
joining.AE* said a spokesperson for Zoom Video Communications in a statement.
The post included tips for users seeking to &€œkeep the party crashersã€ out of
them videoconierences, including limiting screen-sharing to certain
participants and making events invitation-only.
