2/21/19, 11:19 AM - Rumil Ramgaria Barc: 3 options:
a) Take a stake between 10% - 25% in the main entity. It will give us a voice in
the board. will also give us some contrul over the technology. Bowever, it is an
expensive option.
b) Incorporate the JV - JV will tocus on meter development, products and playout
monitoring. While incorporating the JV, we can incorporate obligation clauses
which restricts Sensara from doing competing products for any other entity even
through its main entity. PARC will have a controlling stake in this JV. The JV
can incorporate restrictions on Sensara for areas which are of strategic
interest to BARC.
c) Exclusivity to BARC by Sensara for meter related activities, playout
monitoring and ratings monetization related products.
