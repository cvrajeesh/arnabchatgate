The grapevine is that Union Transpor: Minister Nitin Gadkari gave media baron
Subhash Chandra the cold shoulder recently. It appears that several Central road
projects awarded to Chandraãe™s Essel Infraprojects vere executed sheddily. When
Chandra went to meet Gadkari to resolve the issue, the Minister not anly made
him wait for an hour-and-a-half outside his office, but also warned cf
confiscating Essel Infraprojectsãe* bank guarantee money, if it did not mend its
ways Gadkari apparently has given a three-month notice to Essel to implement
road projects to the satisfaction of his cepartment or face action.
