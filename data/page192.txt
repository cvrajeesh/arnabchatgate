The REACH & TSV of NewslB India has dropped lesser as compared to leading
competition channels. This shows that the News18 India has got disproportionate
viewership in specific markets AS compared to other channels in genre.
Though the Republic Bharat has running commercial duration only 12 mins/hr which
is lowest in genre, but TSV of other channels are higher. (E.g. Zee News
commorcial inventory is 15.5 mins/hr & Republic Bharat is 12. mins/Ar but TSV
on Zee News is 15. 4 mins and Republic Bharat is 14.16 mins)
Following are markets where News18 India has maintained sane viewership in Wk.

channels have dropped remarkably. The Market share of News18 India has increased

6/26/19, 10:06 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Yes vikas forwarded
6/27/19, 10:01 AM - PDGÃO: I ran a very detailed run last night. Tv18 landing
impact is extremely obvious. Tine bands and lancing markets. Can show this LO
you and romil. Please run the outlier for them as well effectively. I:'s not
fair to give them this leeway in Hinci. They have don't no programming to jump
up unnaturally.
6/27/19, 10:05 AM - PDGÃO: No sir not effectively. 1. There is no content
rationale behind their jump 2. This has been accompanied by their landing in
their networks. 3. Makes all my efforts fruitless and utterly pcintless now on.
6/27/19, 10:05 AM - PDGÃC: If this kind of rationalisation of landing benefits
tv 18 then what am I fighting for anyway
6/27/19, :0:05 AM - PDGÃO: I'm not here to help tv 18
6/27/19, :0:05 AM - PDGÃO: Tv18 is a non entity Hindi channel. landing has taken
it to the top. If the govt cracks on landing you will still keep it at the top ?
6/27/19, 10:05 AM - PDGÃO: Then this is pointless
6/27/19, 10:28 AM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Newsl8 is a largely Purjab issue.
Sending you the data
6/27/19, 3:36 EM - PDGÃO: can you ask News team to give me a few points on ABP

6/27/19, 3:36 PM - PDGÃO: will meet Avinash in the eve
6/27/19, 5:30 EM - Romil Pamgaria Barc: ABP News has dropped similar to Genre
compared -O previous weex however the drop is higher compared to PAWA due to
higher increase during election results. ABP's FCT has been the highest in the
last two veeks. Higher SOD to cricket which has a lower yield. story coverage to
encephalitis  in Bihar was also given lesser focus. other importent stories such
as Triple Talac bill, Doctors strike in NB were also given lesser wtg.
6/27/19, 5:30 EM - Romil Famgaria Barc: 1. In wk 21 (election week) ABP had
grown at higner rate than others; consequently it declined more in fullowiny
weeks.
2. ABP's ATS has been low compared to other top channels
3. In HSM Rural, ABP performs well. In HSM Urban, the channel is not so strong.
4. In HSM Urban, they have low exclusive viewers (compared to other top
charnels)
5. Recently their major focus have been on sports; while ICC cricket world cup
on news, has not really worked so well till wk 24. (only aaj tak and ABP have
spent monay on cricket celebrities and have special 30 minute programming)
6/27/19, 7:18 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Niraj story has been quite against and
some lines in the story can be ignored.
6/27/19, 7:23 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Rajini will get the nielsen agreement
