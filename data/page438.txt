independent operaLois fron Delhi attended the TRAI meeting
3) Nr. SK Gupta appeared very upset with DTH operators, he came dcwn heavily
especially on Airtel
4) Mr. Gupta said that MSOS were conperating on NTO vhereas DTII operctors were
not
5) to which Airtel responded that DTH operates in a prepaid model hence it is
difficult to reach out to consumers who are not sharing their p.eferences.. on
the other hand, cable operators hv postpaid model so when the LCO goes for
collecting monthly subscription, he can ask the subscriber to share his
preferences
6) Dish TV claimed 35% subs migrated to NTO, Hathway claimed 351, Siticable
claimed 408 migration, Den claimed 30-35% migration
7) MSOS did mention challenges in getting LCOs on board hence they are focusing
on migrating direct subscribers on priority

numbers - these look like cooked and to push the agenda -

will realize that not more then 8-10% would have been approached -

1/22/19, 3:02 PM - PDGÃO: Spoke to Rushahl - we need to know what all infe TRAI
