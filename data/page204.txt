update on Fastway in Punjab-Urban.
About one month ago, particularly on 6th June, Zee was added on Fastway on
promotional basis for one month. Due to this, Zee improved in Punjab post W23.
One month is completed in W27 but Zee is still available on Fastway & there is
no major reach drop in W2B. Will keep a check on Fastway Panjab for upcoming
weeks.
