6/26/19, 5:38 FM - PDGÃO: Complete rubbish. Everyone followed it. We are being
shafted. Newe 18 has no story no editorial they jump.
6/26/19, 5:47 PM - POGÃO: India tv is never affected. You know vhat they do.
Their outliers aren't outliers. Tv 18 has no content but they are big guys so
can't be touched. Ajtak cen't be touched because shit will hit the ceiling if
they do. Republic obviously are small players. I guess that's the view.
6/26/19, 5:47 PM - PDGÃO: The entire Hindi audience shook because of Bihar.
To
say the channel that led it will fall is cut of the question. If landing
outliers are maintained then on what content basis is tv18 going up.
