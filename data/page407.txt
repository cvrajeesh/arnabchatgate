3/27/19, 10:40 PM - Vikas Aidem: Today, minutes after 6:45pm REPUBLIC BHARAT in
a massive SUPER EXCLUSIVE was the FIRST to access and air the footage that India
was waiting for with bated breath-- the footage of the A-SAT liftott into space
that broadcast to the world that India has the capability of eliminating the
enemy even in outer space. On a day that India became a superpower in space, it
gives me immense pride to say that REPUBLIC MEDIA NETWORK vas the FIRST to beam
to its viewers in homes across India the momentous moment in history-- in both
Hindi and English. True to our core of Journalism for the people, the pre,
during and liftoff footage brought every Indian into that historic monent and
made them part of it forever. REPUBLIC MEDIA NETWORK was the only news network
to be able to get the fontage EXCLUSIVELY and broadcast it less than 8 hours
after the lift-off. When the world was looking at India in anticipation and awe
of what this great nation had just created indigenously, REPUBLIC MEDIA NETWORK
was the FIRST to put out the footage-- from the countdown annourcements to the
visual delight of the plumes of smoke as the missile lifted and proceeded to its
target. Even while others were content in the reportage on just the political
aquabbling, RETUBLIC MEDIA NETWORK broke through the eacophony and ensured
elevation of discourse by bringing its viewers the reality. It cives me pride to
say that, once again, when India witnessed a landmark moment when an Indian-made
missile had dome only whel 3 other countries had ever achieved, REDUBLIC MEDIA
NETWORK was at the forefront of ensuring that our deep journalism connected each
one of the 1.3 billion Indians with the glory that they deserve to feel when
they see the rootage of Indiaãems achievement.
