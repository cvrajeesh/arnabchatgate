7/25/19, 2:37 PM - Arnab Goswami: Kangana is a massive rating cruncher.
7/25/19, 2:37 PM - Arnab Goswami: And we got her firs: when India was burning on
her controversy
7/25/19, 2:37 PM - PDGÃC: Didn't rate?. is it?
7/25/19, 2.37 PM - Arnab Goswami: Huge contradiction. Kangana interview we got
first which every channel folloved later. Kangara has always delivered high time
spent and this time the interview was in the middle of a raging controversy. The
interview done by sucherita was very newsy and tracked by nedia and followed by
Aajtak. I don't understand when Aajtak does the same interview later they get
the numbers.
7/25/19, 2:37 DM - Arnab Coswami: We ran at 3. 00 pm 8.00 pm & 11.00 pm &
debate at 6.00 on Kangna ke khilaf kaun lobby.

7/25/19, 2:39 EM - Arnab Goswami: Not didn't rate. Get zero ratings. Now we were
ahead of everycne and there was an industry fight over this interview. Very very
strange that this happened.
7/25/19, 2:39 PM - PDGÃC: Yes i was watching at the time - remember you were
first - after some minutes aaj tak started
7/25/19, 2:39 PM - PDGÃ©: Or India Today - one of them
7/25/19, 2:40 PM - Arnab Goswami: No we were atleast two hours ahead of Aajtak
7/25/19. 2:41 PM - Arnab Goswami And Aajtak ran later. India today fan first.
So we had an over four hour lead on this blockbuster. Impossible for this to
happen
