1/22/19, 11:18 AM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Venkat has pushed back heavily in last
2 weeks with ETV and ZEE on tampering - hence he feels that if we take this
advisory out may impact his version which was very recent -
1/22/19, 11:19 AM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: The position we are maintaining is that
70% of homes have been changed in the last 6-9 months in AP market
1/22/19, 11:23 AM - PDGÃO: Just had a word with Punit Mishra
1/22/19, 11:23 AM - PDGÃO: Pls call
1/22/19, 11:35 AM - PDGÃO: pls tell him we can take it up for review later but
it has to go like what is stated in our present policy - for now
1/22/19, 11:35 AM - PDGÃO: tell him even Shashi doesnt agree to this change till
a review is done
1/22/19, 11:35 AM - PDGÃO: they should have woken up when we told them earlier
some six nonths back
1/22/19, 11:36 AM - PDCÃO: and Shashi like me thinks it will not affect their
sales
1/22/19, 11:45 AM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Yes have told him
1/22/10, 3:33 IM - PDCÃO: For panel representativeness shonld we not ask TRAI
and MIB to give us which channel is available in how many homes and where post
NTO?
1/22/19, 3:33 FM - POGÃO: What do you think
1/22/19, 3:34 FM - POGÃO: We will otherwise need a BI right? For estimating
Universe?
1/22/19, 3:36 PM - Romil lamgaria Barc: We Call possibly give them a format
letãe™s ask from them - ideally they can get this info and push it to us
1/22/19, 3:37 PM - PDGÃO: Yes we should also push them
1/22/19, 3:37 PM - PDGA©: And write this is fir panel
1/22/19, 3:38 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Yes ok
1/22/19, 3:38 PM - PDGÃO: Rathore $ comment what we heard was not good
1/22/19, 3:38 PM - PDGAO: We are jus: not building relationships there
1/22/19, 3:38 PM - PDGÃO: So we push them hard so that they listen to us
1/22/19, 3:39 PM - PDGÃO: or we raise questions in public platforms to embarass
1/22/19, 3:39 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: My sense is neither will help - TRAL and
MIB are disconnected
1/22/19, 3:39 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: At least we have a good equation in TRA:
1/22/19, 3:39 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: MIB for us is weak
1/22/19, 3:40 PM - PDGÃO: Yes I agree so ve write to MIB - they will refer it to
TRAI
1/22/19, 3:40 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: We need to build more equity there -
specially with Khare - but now he may also be gone - hence directly with Rathore
only
1/22/19, 3:40 PM - PDGÃO: But MIB will also know that they are unaware
1/22/19, 3:41 PM - FDGÃO: Khare news - not sure now - two people told me it's
untrue
1/22/19, 3:41 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: We can write to MIB in response to their
rating suspension letter to us
