5/15/20, 2:23 PM - Romil Ramgar:a Barc: payout issue sorted - mostly
a
communication enming to you
5/15/20, 2:23 PM - Romil Bamgaria Barc: you will receive in may less the
tentative recovery portion of Nov - so basically should get around 60-65
5/15/20, 2:24 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: also siva checked on the GST implication
- apparantly there won't be any implication like that on transfer of car - so
that should also be ok
5/15/20, 2:24 PM - PDGÃO: Thank god
5/15/20, 2:25 PM - PDGÃO: So Noz is nil right?
5/15/20, 2:25 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Yes - few lacs either you will receive
or you will have to pay
5/15/20, 2:25 PM - PDGÃO: Ok
5/15/20, 2:25 PM - Romil Famgaria Barc: Basis final amounts
5/15/20, 2:26 FM - Romi 1 Famgaria Barc: Plus the car transfer
5/15/20, 2:26 PM - PDGÃO: Yes
5/15/20, 2:27 FM - PDGÃO: But - just asking - if I an paying for the car now
shouldn't I get the transfer now? What is the correct interpretation
5/16/20, 10:45 AM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Sorry forgot to respond. Can be argued
both ways. I think it&€™s ok
5/16/20, 10:46 AM - PDGÃO: ok
5/16/20, 10:46 AM - PDGÃO: But no mail yet
5/16/20, 10:48 AM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: May cone early next week - will check
5/17/20, 2:47 PM - PDGÃO: Siva was messaging me some calculations
5/17/20, 2:47 PM - I notice everytime figures change - November 19, then
April 20 then now May 20
5/17/20, 2:48 PM - PDGÃO: Showed my displeasure to him
5/17/20, 2:58 2M - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Is it? He told me the figures have
remsined same at gross level - he messaged me that some net 61 going out to you
now - and some 20-21 being withheld towards foreclosure and recovery
5/17/20, 2:58 PM - PDGÃO: Every time it's different
5/17/20, 2:50 PM - PDCÃO: This foreclosure and recovery again is new
5/17/20, 2:59 PM - EDGÃO: And some TCS
5/17/20, 2:59 PM - PDGÃO: Recovery was supposed to be in November alongwith
LransFer of asset
5/17/20, 3:00 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Because they want to take one more firm
opinion on sales tax. Yes bank still not given foreclosure charges. They are
holding back 51 towards all this - which to me is ok bosa
5/17/20, 3:00 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Atleast mentally you wonã€™t have
a
liability to pay in nov
5/17/20, 3:00 PM - Romil kamgaria Barc: Unlikely if there is no sales tax burden
-
5/17/20, 3:02 PM - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Also if you Look at the other way - emi
paynent is an outflow of every month but not recovering that every nonth -
hence should be ok na
5/17/20, 3:02 PM - FDGÃO: That's their inefficiency na? Technically : lose
interest on that if I have to be sticky - see I may be ok with all this but the
fact that numbers change in every iteration bugs me - maybe something is wrong
5/17/20, 3:02 PM - PDGÃO; Yes but you never know if another calculation will
come then
5/17/20, 3:02 ?M - Romil Ramgaria Barc: Gross level it hasnã€™t changed - it
remains same - but 1 will double check -
5/17/20, 3:03 PM - PDGÃO: TCS vas not there in earlier twc calculations
