center for complaints, gives phone no. 0120 ã€" 6898689 or e-mail at
das@trai.gov.ir
The Tolcoom Regulatory Authority of India has issued new directions to cable anc
DTH operators prohibiting them from forcing any channel other than
Doordarsharãe™s on their consumers in the name of &€-base packsá€™ or achbasic
service and also set up a call center to deil with such complaints
The move comes in the wake of hundreds of complaints on social nedia from
consumers that their many DTH and cable operators are simply refuoing to allow
users to edit or change their base packs.
Instead, consuners have complained, these cable and DTH operators ore telling
their customers that the a€"base packãe™ cannot be changed and that any pack
they add will be over and above this.
Authority has been informed that some service providers are pushing
certain packages, not allowing choice within first 100 channels providing
certain FTA channels irrespective of options etc. The authority has
taken a note of such issues and has directed the distribution platform operators
to follow the regulation in letter and spirit.
&€œThe consumer choice and paying only for what the consumer wishes to watch, is
the power, the new framework gives to subscribers. The subscribers are free to
choose Free to Air channels and / or pay channels either en a-lacarte or in the
forn of bouque: or any combination thereoi, even within the first one hundred
channels, ã€. it said.
TRAI also gave a phone number and email ID for consumers to register their
complainto aboat any euch errant behavior by their cable er DTH operator.
