1/16/19, 9:06 PM - Rushabb Rajesh Mehta: Sir in the illustration they are
mentioning if out of 100 subs that operator has if 75 subs buy bouquet then it
will b beneficial for the operator bcoz of the commission that he gets rather
than 23 subs buying a-la-carte and 52 buying a bouquet in other words they
are trying to tell operators to push for Star bouquets

calculation that they have shown

1/16/19, 11:37 PM - Rushabh Rajesh Mehta: Sure Sir
1/16/19, 11:40 PM - 2ushabh Rajesh Mehta: The calculation is as follows
