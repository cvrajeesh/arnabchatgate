We met Saurabh Yagnik on the follow up meeting from the meeting we did last week
with Danish Khan SET head wherein Danish had approved PrimaVU. The meeting
with Saurabh lasted for over 1.5 hours wherein he was negative throughout he
was questioning that why are we confusing the market by creating it a separate
offering and not intagrating with the currency panel. he wanted us to share the
PrimaVU universe by cities and by HD penetration, shud we share this data?
Saurabh Yagnik may try to stall it PrimaVC therefore we are meeting indizidual
channel teams to push for the closure.
Therefore we also met Ajay Bhalwankar (3ony Marathi) Busineas head and presented
PrimaVU the fact that Sony Marathi has higher coverage than Zee Marathi in
PrimaVU made Ajay very happy the also texted it to NP
