They were asking whether the agencies and advertisers were showing any interest.
Also askec how will PrimaVU become a trading currency. To which we responded
that itãems been only about couple of weeks and both agencies and advertisers
are showing keen interest in PrimaVU.
They will write back to us asking for some data (Cume Reach, ATS) across all
genres. After looking at the 4 veske trend. they will again call for a meeting
and then take a call on PrimaVU subscription
7/16/19, 5:40 PM - Rushabh Rajesh Mehta: Updates from PrimaVU meeting with
colors - Arnab Das and team
They were appreciative of the PrimaVU offering but were concerned with Colors
not appearing in the top 5 Hind: GEC list.
They wud want to have access to Primavo asap. So we requested Alnal to put in
a
word in order to speed up our ongoing discussion with commercial team.
We also met Amit Derasaria from Commercial team separately. He wanted to
negotiate on the pricing to which we said PrimaVU offering is similar to
currency panel and hence we would not be able to do any alterations in the
PrimaVU subscription fees.
@Romil sir - Amit mentioned since he was part of your team, he wud want to try
negotiating it with you once before he gives a go ahead 88's, to which we said
he is free to reach out to you but it is unlikely that pricing wud change. At
the same time, he also requested us to share the documents for completing the
paperwork on PrimaVU.
We also showed PrimaVU to Deepak Rajdhyaksha, Business head of Colors Marathi
and his team They were also happy to see Colors Marathi almost being neck-to-
neck with Zee Marathi on PrimaVJ
