7/25/19, 4:23 PM - PDGAID: And we got her first when india vas burning on her
controversy
7/25/19, 4:23 FM - PDGÃO Huge contradiction. Kangana interview we got first
which every channel followed later. Kangana has always delivered high time spent
and this time the interview was in the middle of a raging controversy. The
interview done by sucherita was very newsy and tracked by media and followed by
Aajtak. I don't understand when Aajtak does the same interview later they get
the numbers.

7/25/19, 3:34 PM - Romil Eamgaria Barc: First of all none of the business
channels are on landing and hence no treatment at our end. CNBC anyways used to
get lower viewership from Megacities. This time it has crashed n so has ET now.
