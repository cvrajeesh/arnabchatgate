to all clients. you and partho da will have to support me in the sense that pls
disuade the clients to directly reach to you, more so when we are proactively
trying to reach out to them. Here I am not taking about Kalli, Uday and Rajant
31 and the likes we are documenting everything and tomorrow they camnot blame
us for being reactive. but till the time you entertain these guys they will
never reach out to us. may lobe slowly but you have to tell them that we have
got a competitive team to work with you guys and only if Lhings doesn&€™t change
they may reach, call, write or even compliant against us

and till the time current rule to continue 7) it also observed that cetails of
statistical forums for landing or tampering should not be discussed with tech
