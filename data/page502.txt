There has been a 3 Mn decline in channel reach (70 Mr. to 67 Mn) led by Delhi and
Mumbai. There has been no change in distribution; so we are unsure about the
reason for this decline. Impact of competition (if any) should have resulted in
a decline in engagement and not reach
Decline in wk 40 (Navratri) ã€" We would like to'understand the reason for the
highest decline for SP as compared to other charnelo
This year SP showed a decline from 189 (wk 39) A 174 GRPs (wk 40) A 165 GRPs
(wk 41). The decline has continued fcr 2 weeks; while, other channels have not
shown this level of decline across the 2 weeks
Even in 2018 (removing the impact of Dance+ launch week), Star Plus would have
been 196 GRPs (from 202 GRPs) which was only a 3% drop as compared to the 6%
this time. 2017 also saw a fall of 6% (from 181 to 171) which is lower than this
yearãems fall
This decline does not match the Tata Sky trend:
Wk 41 shoved a 4X fall as compared to SP (SP: 148 A 143 GRPs, Sony: 180 A 160
GRPs)
However on BARC, Sony remained consistent ( 195 GRPs A 194 GRPs) while Star
Plus fell from 174 A 165 GRPs.
